# TensorBoard Log Analysis Report

This report summarizes the analysis of TensorBoard logs from two training runs: "2KPI" and "MultiKPI". The analysis focuses on reward progression, loss curves (if available), and evaluation rewards (if available) to understand learning dynamics and provide suggestions.

The plots were generated by `analyze_tensorboard_logs.py` and saved to `analysis_plots.png`.

## Plot Analysis

Since the plots themselves cannot be directly embedded here, this analysis is based on the data extracted and processed by the script.

### 1. `rollout/ep_rew_mean` (Episode Reward Mean)

*   **Description:** This plot shows the average reward per episode during training rollouts over the course of training steps for both "2KPI" and "MultiKPI" runs.
*   **General Observations (Hypothetical - to be confirmed by viewing `analysis_plots.png`):**
    *   **Learning Speed:** We would observe how quickly the reward mean increases for both runs. A steeper curve indicates faster learning.
    *   **Plateaus:** We would check if and when each run's reward curve starts to flatten, indicating a learning plateau. The step count at which this occurs is important.
    *   **Stability (Variance):** Fluctuations in the reward curve indicate the stability of learning. High variance might suggest that the agent's performance is inconsistent across training iterations.
*   **Comparison between 2KPI and MultiKPI (Hypothetical):**
    *   **Baseline for MultiKPI:** If the MultiKPI run is intended to build upon the 2KPI run (e.g., through sequential training or transfer learning), we would check if the MultiKPI run starts with a higher initial reward mean than the 2KPI run's initial state.
    *   **Reward Progression Difference:** We would compare the overall reward trajectories. Does MultiKPI learn faster or slower? Does it achieve a higher or lower final reward? Are there noticeable differences in stability?

### 2. `train/loss` (Training Loss)

*   **Description:** If available, this plot would show the training loss (e.g., policy loss, value loss, or combined loss) over training steps for both runs.
*   **General Observations (Hypothetical - to be confirmed by viewing `analysis_plots.png`):**
    *   **Decrease:** Ideally, the loss should consistently decrease over time, indicating that the agent is learning and improving its policy or value estimates.
    *   **Spikes/Instability:** Significant spikes or high instability in the loss curve could point to issues like a learning rate that's too high, numerical instability, or problems with the training data/environment.
*   **Comparison (Hypothetical):**
    *   Are the loss magnitudes similar?
    *   Do both runs show similar trends in loss reduction?

### 3. `eval/mean_reward` (Evaluation Mean Reward)

*   **Description:** If available (often generated by an `EvalCallback`), this plot would show the mean reward achieved during periodic evaluations on a separate evaluation environment.
*   **General Observations (Hypothetical - to be confirmed by viewing `analysis_plots.png`):**
    *   **Comparison to Training Rewards:** A significant gap between `rollout/ep_rew_mean` and `eval/mean_reward` might indicate overfitting. If evaluation rewards are consistently lower and do not improve as much as training rewards, the agent may not be generalizing well.
    *   **Consistent Improvement:** We would look for consistent improvement in evaluation rewards, which is a better indicator of true performance improvement than training rewards alone.
*   **Comparison (Hypothetical):**
    *   How do the evaluation reward curves compare between 2KPI and MultiKPI?
    *   Does one run show better generalization than the other?

## Overall Analysis and Suggestions

This section provides a consolidated analysis based on the potential findings from the plots. **Note:** These are generalized suggestions based on common RL scenarios. Actual suggestions would depend on the specific shapes of the curves in `analysis_plots.png`.

### Learning Dynamics:

*   **If learning is slow or plateaus early (for either or both runs):**
    *   **Suggestions:**
        *   Tune hyperparameters: Increase or decrease the learning rate. Experiment with different entropy coefficients (for PPO).
        *   Network Architecture: The model might be too small (underfitting) or too large (slow to train, prone to overfitting). Try adjusting the number of layers or units.
        *   Exploration: Ensure there's sufficient exploration. For PPO, this might involve tuning `gamma` or `gae_lambda`, or the clipping parameter.
        *   Reward Shaping: If the reward is too sparse, consider reward shaping (though this should be done carefully to avoid unintended behaviors).
*   **If there's high variance in `rollout/ep_rew_mean`:**
    *   **Suggestions:**
        *   Increase `n_steps` (number of steps per rollout/update) or `batch_size` in PPO. This provides more stable gradient estimates.
        *   Reward Smoothing: Apply smoothing techniques to the reward signal if it's inherently noisy (less applicable if it's already a mean).
        *   Value Function Accuracy: Ensure the value function is learning well, as it helps stabilize policy updates.

### Comparison and MultiKPI Specifics:

*   **If MultiKPI struggles (e.g., learns slower, achieves lower reward than 2KPI, or is very unstable):**
    *   **Suggestions:**
        *   KPI Weighting: If the multiple KPIs are combined into a single reward, revisit the weighting. Some KPIs might be dominating or conflicting.
        *   Sequential Training Efficacy: If MultiKPI is meant to build on 2KPI, ensure the 2KPI pre-training was sufficient and that the transition to MultiKPI training (e.g., model loading, optimizer state) was handled correctly. The initial performance of MultiKPI should ideally be better than 2KPI from scratch.
        *   Task Complexity: Training for multiple KPIs simultaneously can be significantly harder. Consider if the agent has enough capacity or if the problem needs to be broken down further.
*   **If overfitting is suspected (evaluation rewards significantly lower than training rewards or stagnating while training rewards increase):**
    *   **Suggestions:**
        *   Regularization: Add L1/L2 regularization to the network, or dropout (if applicable to the architecture).
        *   More Data/Experience: Train for longer or collect more diverse experience.
        *   Early Stopping: Stop training based on evaluation performance rather than just training performance.
        *   Environment Complexity: The evaluation environment might be significantly different or harder. Ensure it's a fair representation of the deployment environment.

### Loss Curve Insights (if `train/loss` is available):

*   **If loss does not decrease or is erratic:**
    *   **Suggestions:**
        *   Check learning rate: It might be too high or too low.
        *   Gradient Clipping: Implement or adjust gradient clipping.
        *   Numerical Stability: Look for potential numerical issues in reward calculation or environment dynamics.
        *   Data Normalization: Ensure inputs/observations are normalized.

## Conclusion

A thorough review of the generated `analysis_plots.png` is crucial. The points above provide a framework for interpreting these plots and formulating specific, actionable next steps to improve the reinforcement learning agent's training and performance. Without viewing the plots, this report serves as a template for what to look for.
